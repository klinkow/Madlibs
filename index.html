        <p>Donald Trump was on his way to work at Trump Tower, riding the Trump <span class="one"></span>.  He arrived after <span class="two"></span> days of travel, resting his <span class="three"></span> on his desk out of exhaustion. "Boy, I'm <span class="four"></span>," he exclaimed with frustration.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Hillary found the prospect of the next <span class="five"></span> on the campaign trail exhausting.  Trump was such a fucking <span class="six"></span>.  "I should be greatful for that fact," she kept reminding herself, since it meant she shouldn't really have to stress too much.  Yet Hillary got no comfort from acknowledging that the campaign that would lead to the realization of her life's ambitions was a joke.  It was a real <span class="seven"></span> in the pants.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Donald put down his <span class="eight"></span> and got to work, calling upon the greatest minds he could summon for campaign advise.  <span class="nine"></span>, or at least someone convincingly dressed like <span class="nine"></span> suggested taking a hawkish approach towards ISOL.  Trump liked the idea, and also liked the sound of his voice liking the idea. <span class="ten"></span>, or at least someone Trump had hired to act as <span class="ten"></span> wanted to discuss the specifics of the plan to "exterminate the <span class="eleven"></span>", but Donald had heard enough for one day and decided to watch <span class="twelve"></span> instead.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Hillary knew she had to be ready for anything, since literally anything seemed to be a possible talking point at the next debate.  Would Trump discuss <span class="thirteen"></span>? Or would he just go back to talking about <span class="fourteen"></span>'s again.  On and on about <span class="fourteen"></span>'s, he just wouldn't let it go.  Hillary's decided she only had one option, to make like a <span class="fifteen"></span> and <span class="sixteen"></span>.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>THE END!</p>
